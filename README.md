##[DEMO](http://juliaebert.com/jekyll-polymer)

A [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme built with [Google's Polymer library](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) and following the material design specifications.

There are a few custom web components included designed to match Material design.

I created this theme because I couldn't figure out how to set up a Jekyll project to play nicely with Polymer, and because I didn't find any Jekyll blog themes available that used Polymer or followed Google's material design specifications.

## Features

- Full-text search with [simple-jekyll-search](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search)
- Paginated home page
- Support for featured post images (appear on cards in previews)
- Threaded comments with Disqus
- Google Analytics integration
- One-command deployment to Github Pages
- Tagged posts

## Installation instructions

(Instructions are based off of those for the [Polymer Starter Kit](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit).)

- Clone this repository or download it as a .zip file and unzip.
- Install jekyll (and any other Ruby gems) with `bundle install`. (Prerequisite: must have Ruby installed. You may also have to install bundler with `gem install bundler`.)
- From the project root folder, run `npm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install`. (See the [Polymer Starter Kit installation instructions](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit#install-dependencies) for more details or troubleshooting.)

## Structure

- `app/`: All Jekyll content is here. (This is where all the editing happens)
  - `bower_components`: Content installed via bower ends up here
  - `elements/`: Custom web components using Polymer
  - `images/`: User images
  - `media/`: Other user content (PDFs, videos, etc.) for final product
  - `scripts/`: Javascript files
  - `styles/`: Custom CSS
- `dist/`: Built output from Gulp. (Use to publish static content)
- `node_modules`: Content installed via npm goes here

## Deployment

### Serve/watch

`gulp serve`: Starts a jekyll serve process on the default port (4000 or whatever is specified in `_config.yml`).

`gulp serve --port 6666`: Start serving on port `6666`

`gulp serve:dist`: Build as below, and serve the result from the `dist/` directory. (Useful for testing changes to the gulpfile. Currently does not work with a Jekyll baseurl configured.)

### Build and vulcanize

`gulp`: Builds the files with jekyll, vulcanizes, minimizes, and puts the result in the `dist/` directory. (This can be slow.)

## Deploy

`gulp deploy-gh-pages`: Deploy the current build to the gh-pages branch of your repository.

`gulp build-deploy-gh-pages`: Rebuild and then deploy. (Equivalent to `gulp && gulp deploy-gh-pages`)

## Future Improvements:

- Improve gulp build
    - Minimize JS, CSS, HTML
- Search
    - Escape toggles search show
    - arrow keys/tab moves focus on search results
    - better animation for search bar leaving/entering
- Navigation drawer
    - Change hover effect on drawer items (see Google Music)
    - Make selected/active items in drawer colored
- Page transition animations
- Give option of setting card-colorbar color
- Add ripple effect to nav drawer menu items
- Pagination:
    - Maybe replace with actual buttons
    - hover effects like buttons?
    - Handle if it gets too wide for screen? (limit number of page links)
- Tags
    - Allow filtering by tag (have list of all tags)
- Add material box or lightbox for images
- Add 'source' option for YAML frontmatter
- increase spacing between list items
- Fix things like header-panel to utilize updates to polymer paper elements

### Known issues

- JS and HTML aren't minimized
- Too much space on cards between end of excerpt and read more button
