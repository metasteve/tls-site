I am a neuroscience researcher, aspiring roboticist and bioengineer, amateur designer, occasional curler, and avid baker.

I am currently completing a MRes in bioengineering at Imperial College London as a Marshall Scholar. I previously graduated from Northeastern University with a BS in behavioral neuroscience and a minor in computer science. <!--In the fall, I will begin a PhD in computer science at Harvard University.-->

I fully expect any given person to ignore at least 50% of what I post here. If you're interested in what I'm up to in the UK, chances are that you probably don't about how to install the font libraries for LabView in Linux or the role of big data in current biology research.
